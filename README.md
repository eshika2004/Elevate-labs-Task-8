# Online Sales Data Dashboard ðŸ“Š

This project is part of my **8th internship task**, where I created an interactive dashboard to analyze online sales data.  
The dashboard provides insights into:

- **Regional Sales:** Asia recorded the highest units sold, while Europe had the lowest.  
- **Product Categories:** Clothing contributed the most to sales, whereas Electronics had the least share.  
- **Payment Methods:** Credit Cards were the most preferred payment option.  
- **Monthly Trends:** Sales peaked in March and gradually declined towards August.  

The visualization helps in understanding sales distribution across regions, product categories, payment methods, and monthly performance.
